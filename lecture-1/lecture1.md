## Brief History of Computer Vision

Prof Fei Fei Li explains evolution of vision in animals. Then professor explains the origin of vision and how we perceive objects. Then she explained Imagenet competition.

## cs231n overview
Primary focus of the class is image classification. Several other visual recognition problems like object detection, image captioning, action classification and more.

Concolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have become an important tool for obejct detection. CNNs had a break through moment in 2012 and people are tweaking and tuning them to get better results. Foundational works of CNN was done by LeCunn et al. in 1988, the structure of that network looks similar to AlexNet by Krizhevsky et al. in 2012. 

If algo were around in 90s why they have become popular right now? reason faster and faster computers, the transistors have grown in chips, so just by having more compute available helped researchers explore bigger models. Another reason is data, annotated data 90s were not that big compared to the dataset on which AlexNet was trained. 

"The quest for visual intelligence goes far beyond objection recognition..."

There are too many open challenges are needs to be solved with computer vision, some of those challenges are semantic segmentation, perceptual grouping, reconstructing the entire world, activity recognition and much more!! Very vast field where tons of work needs to be done.  

## Philosophy

- Through and Detailed
    - Understand how to write from scratch, debug, and train convolutional neural networks
- Practical
    - Focus on practical techinques for training these networks at scale, and on GPUs (eg will touch on distributed optimization, differences between CPUs vs GPUs, etc) Also look at the state of the art software tool such as Caffe, Tensorflow and PyTorch
- State of the art
    - Most materials are new from research world in the past 1-3 years. Very excitiing stuff.
- Fun
    - Some function topics such as Image Captioning using RNN
    - Also DeepDream, NeuralStyle, etc
